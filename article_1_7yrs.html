                <p class="lead">I have been blessed to be born in an environment where I could see opportunities that allowed me to become a better person, both professionally and spiritually. My parents have never been tech savvy but they recognised the importance of technology. In 2010, my neighbours were throwing out their old PC because they were buying a new one. Instead of wasting it, my Dad offered to purchase it for me and allowed me to go crazy with it. It was an old computer and my dad gave me full freedom to play with it. I was told <em>“It is okay even if you break it, just make the most of this”</em>

                <p id="inner">When I was in Class 6, I started learning Photoshop, After Effects and HTML. I know it sounds absurd but I wasn’t an expert either. I was a single child with access to internet at an age where boys don’t really think about all the other stuff kids do on the internet these days. I started learning Photoshop and After Effects and <strong>by the time I reached Class 10, I got really good at it.</strong></p>
                
                <p id="inner">One day I get approached by a senior who offered to take me for an inter-school competition at DPS Vasant Kunj. My best friend Shahnil and I made a team and prepared ourselves to participate in our first competition. This was the first time I was ever outside school for an event. I usually thought that only sports had competitions, why would anyone else learn stuff like HTML at my age.</p>
                
                <p id="inner">I entered and saw a thousand students at the event desk, <strong>all charged up to compete for events like Quiz, Digital Imaging, Video Editing, 3D Modelling, Hardware Design, Mechanics and what not.</strong> Shahnil and I were ready to lose because we knew these guys were senior. They all looked so tall, so bulky and so smart. We were so fresh, all tied up like perfect students. We felt like we were at Oscars, surrounded by celebrity geeks. We were at our absolute perfect behavior.</p>

                <p id="inner">God was with us and I won in my competition. I came first in my category and I felt so proud. I came back and saw my computer teacher, Divya ma’am congratulate me. She offered me to go for IPSC IT Fest, which was an all India tech event held at Welham’s Boys School. I was instantly getting way too much attention and I was loving it. I went to Welham’s and sat in a room filled with Class 12 students and when the results came, I came first <strong>again </strong>. I thought I was going to be huge now. I was a new amateur student who had just entered as a junior and won twice back to back, beating all seniors. Everyone was praising me, seniors who were 4 years elder to me were asking when they come to learn design from me. In short, <strong>I thought</strong> I was the best.</p>

                 <p id="inner">There is a difference between only thinking about winning and focussing only on winning. If you do not think about winning you will never work. The loophole is that people <strong>do not stop at thinking about winning.</strong> They obsess over it, they make it their everything and <strong>eventually drain themseleves with anxiety and worry.</strong> I used to make the same mistake as well.</p>
                
                
               <h3 id="line">I was all about winning and beating other teams. This attitude drained me, it gave me pressure because I used to feel bad when I lost and I wanted to do everything I could to avoid that feeling.</h3>
                
                <p id="inner">The mindset that I practice now has competely changed me and my state of mind. It has not only <strong>helped me win more but exponentially</strong> improved my mental health, relationships and view towards life and that is:</p>
                
                <h2><mark>The only thing you can control is being a strong competitor.</mark> </h2>
                
                <p id="inner"> You can control how amazing your product is going to be. You can control how brilliantly you can play the match. You can control how dedicately you prepare for the exam. Winning a competition is temporary but becoming a strong competitor is a life long trait.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Even if you lose your match or competition, people should feel that it was difficult beating you. If I look at myself today, my aim is to be a strong competitor, not the winner.<br><br>

Winning involves a lot of variables that are not in my hand. I can work very hard but some unexpected disaster or unseen mistake can spoil my chance at winning. Contrary to this you can control how strong you fight. You can control how hard you punch. You can control how quick you respond and that is all that matters.
